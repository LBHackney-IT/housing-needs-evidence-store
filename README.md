## Getting started
To run the project locally, which will give you hot reloading whenever you make a change to a file within the src directory - just run this...
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Running the tests
To run the tests in watch mode, handy for TDD, you can run...
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Or, if you just want to run the tests once...
```bash
npm test
```
