## Getting started

This project uses **npm** for dependency management.

1.  Install the project dependencies
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Start running your local copy of evidence store!
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Testing

### Unit tests

```bash
npm test # runs all unit tests
npm test:watch # runs all unit tests, in watch mode
```

### Integration tests

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

By default integration tests will run against the local version of evidence store, you can configure this to run against any URL by setting an environment variable before running the tests.

```bash
export INTEGRATION_TEST_BASE_URL=https://my.evidence.store/test
npm run test:integration
```

## Deployment

### Temporary personal deployments

You can deploy a temporary copy of the application, if you want to debug in a real AWS environment.

```bash
npm run deploy:personal
npm run deploy:personal:cleanup # remember to remove it when you're done!
```

### Automated deployments

CircleCI will run unit and integration tests when a new PR is opened, these do not test the deployment of the application to AWS. They run against local copy of the application running in the CircleCI job instead.

Merging into `master` triggers a new deployment to staging, there is a manual approval process in CircleCI to trigger deployment to production.
